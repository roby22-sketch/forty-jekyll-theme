<h2 id="content">Research Interests and CV</h2>
<p>Broadly, my work tries to use applied mathematical models to udnertsnad biological processes. These preocesses range from chemoresistance, to Alzheimer's Disease, to ecology. I try to apply these models to create a more informed future by applying quanititative precision to normally abstract concepts. </p>

		<h3>Mathematical Modeling of Cancer</h3>
		<p>In the summer of 2023 I began working in the Department of Cell Biology and Biochemistry at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center under Dr. Komoraiah Palle. In the lab we focus on elcuidating the molecular mechanisms cancer utilizes to thwart chemotherapy. I use MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and Live Cell Imaging methods to fit and parametrize growth curves of chemoresistant and senistive cell lines under cytotoxic stress. The evolution of these parameters across various platforms can reveal hidden patterns in the way cancers develop chemoresistance. Additionally, I was apart of a project that developed 5-FlouroUracil resistant colorectal cancer cell lines to test a novel 2nd generation flouropyrimidine. Finally, I dontributed to a publication which determined that the combination of PARG and CHK1 inhibitors synergistically kill chemoresistant ovarian cancer. (See Publication here). Through all of these projects I have gained an intimate understanding of refining protocols, and the rigor of science. I am very well trained and capable with cytotoxicity and biochemical assays like clonogenic survival and the MTT assay, agarose and SDS page gel electrophoresis, and immunoflourescence experiments.  </p>

		<h3>Dynamical Systems and Brain Modelling</h3>
		<p>Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's are highly complex and multiscale. It is of utmost importance to understand the key drivers of disease progression. Furthermore, developing mathematical models that describe such diseases can provide insight towards devloping effective therapeutics. I try to understand the critical drivers of Alzheimer's disease whihc drive treatment progression from a mathematical perspective. The brain can be viewed as a simple network with nodes and edges, a specifically useful tool for algebraic topoplogists. Using various methods, we can model the progression of prion like proteins throughout the brain while investigating the roles of clearance, inflammation, and various other biological factors. Our group has developed a high-performance scienctific computing library to colve these models on a complex network which can simulate disease progression from a multitude of angles. Through this research we hope to uncover the critical factors which lead to Amyloid Beta plauqes, Tau tangles, and Alheimer's Disease. </p>
